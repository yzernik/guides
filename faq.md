## Can I get rich by routing Lightning payments?
Nobody knows. Probably not. You will get minimal fees. I don't care. Enjoy the ride!

## Can I attach the Ext4 formatted hard disk to my Windows computer?
The Ext4 file system is not compatible with standard Windows, but with additional software like  [Linux File Systems](https://www.paragon-software.com/home/linuxfs-windows/#faq) by Paragon Software (they offer a 10 days free trial) it is possible.

## What do all the Linux commands do?
This is a (very) short list of common Linux commands for your reference. For a specific command, you can enter `man [command]` to display the manual page (type `q` to exit).

| command | description | example |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `cd` | change to directory | `cd /home/umbrel` |
| `ls` | list directory content | `ls -la /home/umbrel/umbrel` |
| `cp` | copy | `cp file.txt newfile.txt` |
| `mv` | move | `mv file.txt moved_file.txt`
| `rm` | remove | `rm temporaryfile.txt`
| `mkdir` | make directory | `mkdir /home/umbrel/newdirectory`
| `ln` | make link | `ln -s /target_directory /link`
| `sudo` | run command as superuser | `sudo nano textfile.txt`
| `su` | switch to different user account | `sudo su root`
| `chown` | change file owner  | `chown umbrel:umbrel myfile.txt`
| `chmod` | change file permissions | `chmod +x executable.script`
| `nano` | text file editor | `nano textfile.txt`
| `tar` | archive tool | `tar -cvf archive.tar file1.txt file2.txt`
| `exit` | exit current user session | `exit`
| `systemctl` | control systemd service | `sudo systemctl start umbrel-startup`
| `journalctl` | query systemd journal | `sudo journalctl -u umbrel-external-storage`
| `htop` | monitor processes & resource usage | `htop`
| `shutdown` | shutdown or restart Pi | `sudo shutdown -r now`


## Where can I get more information?

## Setting a fixed address on the Raspberry Pi
If your router does not support setting a static ip address for a single device, you can also do this directly on the Raspberry Pi.

This can be done by configuring the DHCP-Client (on the Pi) to advertise a static IP address to the DHCP-Server (often the router) before it automatically assigns a different one to the Raspberry Pi.

1. Get ip address of default gateway (router).
   Run `netstat -r -n` and choose the IP address from the gateway column which is not `0.0.0.0`. In my occasion it's `192.168.178.1`.

2. Configure the static IP address for the Pi, the gateway path and a DNS server.
   The configuration for the DHCP client (Pi) is located in the `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` file:
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf
   ```
   The following snippet is an example of a sample configuration. Change the value of `static routers` and `static domain_name_servers` to the IP of your router (default gateway) from step 1. Be aware of giving the Raspberry Pi an address which is **OUTSIDE** the range of addresses which are assigned by the DHCP server. You can get this range by looking under the router configurations page and checking for the range of the DHCP addresses. This means, that if the DHCP range goes from `192.168.178.1` to `192.168.2.99` you're good to go with the IP `192.168.178.100` for your Raspberry Pi.

   Add the following to the `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` file:
   ```
   # Configuration static IP address (CHANGE THE VALUES TO FIT FOR YOUR NETWORK)
   interface eth0
   static ip_address=192.168.178.100/24
   static routers=192.168.178.1
   static domain_name_servers=192.168.178.1
   ```

3. Restart networking system
  `sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart`


## Does Umbrel support .....?
Currently not, but the we are working on an application infrastructure, so third-party developers can add their own apps to Umbrel.


## How can I use WiFi instead of Ethernet?


* Create a file `wpa_supplicant.conf` in the boot partition of the microSD card with the following content.
  Note that the network name (ssid) and password need to be in double-quotes (like `psk="password"`)

  ```conf
  ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
  update_config=1
  country=[COUNTRY_CODE]
  network={
    ssid="[WIFI_SSID]"
    psk="[WIFI_PASSWORD]"
  }
  ```

* Replace `[COUNTRY_CODE]` with the [ISO2 code](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search){:target="_blank"} of your country (eg. `US`)
* Replace `[WIFI_SSID]` and `[WIFI_PASSWORD]` with the credentials for your own WiFi.
